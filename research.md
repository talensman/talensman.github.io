	Transformative technologies like generative AI promise to accelerate productivity growth across many sectors, but they also present new risks from potential misuse. We develop a multi-sector technology adoption model to study the optimal regulation of transformative technologies when society can learn about these risks over time. Socially optimal adoption is gradual and typically convex. If social damages are large and proportional to the new technology's productivity, a higher growth rate paradoxically leads to slower optimal adoption. Equilibrium adoption is inefficient when firms do not internalize all social damages, and sector-independent regulation is helpful but generally not sufficient to restore optimality.

	We study the implications of ambiguity for optimal ﬁscal policy in macro public ﬁnance environments with heterogeneous agents and private idiosyncratic shocks. We describe conditions under which ambiguity implies that it is optimal to periodically reform policies. Periodic reforms lead to simpliﬁed optimal policies that are not fully contingent on future shocks; at times they also lose dependence on the full history of past shocks. These simpliﬁed policies can be characterized without complete backward induction when the time horizon is ﬁnite. However, linear policies can be far from optimal. We also show that equilibria in decentralized versions of these economies are not generally efﬁcient, implying a meaningful role for government provision of insurance, unlike in conventional environments with a narrower view of uncertainty.

	We study the implications of endogenous input prices for horizontal merger policy when input prices are set before goods prices. Generalizing the ﬁrst-order approach of Farrell and Shapiro (2010) and Jaffe and Weyl (2013), we derive a measure of unilateral incentives to adjust input prices after a downstream merger, Input Pricing Pressure. We use this measure to show that mergers often incentivize higher input prices, and that these incentives hinge on changes in downstream pass-through rates and marginal cost efﬁciencies generated by the merger. By implication, consumer surplus-maximizing antitrust policy may be too lax when input prices are assumed ﬁxed, and it should be biased against claims that input prices will fall after a downstream merger. In an empirical application to local retail beer markets, endogenizing input prices substantially raises the consumer harm from mergers of retailers.

<p><b-custom>Entrepreneurship and Productivity Growth in Tight Labor Markets</b-custom></p>

<details style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: -15px">
	<summary style="color: #2a7ae2">Abstract</summary>

	Motivated by recent evidence linking local labor market tightness to business creation, I study conditions under which a positive aggregate demand shock can raise productivity growth by incentivizing high-tech entrepreneurship. I develop a search model of the labor market in which workers face an occupational choice between employment and entrepreneurship. Successful entrepreneurs create firms by adopting technologies from a productivity frontier, while unsuccessful ones become unemployed. An aggregate demand shock that raises labor demand has an ambiguous effect on entrepreneurship: A tighter labor market lowers the cost of failure by shortening unemployment spells, but it also directly raises the opportunity cost of entrepreneurship. The former channel dominates when successful entrepreneurs primarily come from employment, providing a mechanism by which an increase in aggregate demand can increase productivity. This mechanism suggests a novel role for accommodative monetary policy to stimulate productivity growth, and I consider methods to estimate its magnitude in the data.

<p><b-custom>A Theory of Innovative Firms and Power over New Technologies and Researchers</b-custom><br>
with Abhijit Tagade</p>

<details style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: -15px">
	<summary style="color: #2a7ae2">Abstract</summary>

	We construct a theory to explain the emergence of large, innovative firms as a means to internalize spillovers in the innovation process, and we show how these firms exert power over the direction of innovation and the labor market for researchers. Researchers must choose one of several technologies to study, and their innovations generate knowledge spillovers to others working on the same technology. A manager can internalize these spillovers by coordinating researchers’ innovation decisions, raising economic growth given a fixed set of technologies. But with limits to firm size from convex monitoring costs, this innovative firm can instead slow growth and reduce welfare when new technologies arrive over time: If innovation is combinatorial, so that the owners of past innovations for a technology benefit from subsequent ones, the firm has an incentive to pursue an old technology even as outside researchers exploit a more productive new one. Limits to firm size imply that spillovers are only partially internalized, so the equilibrium direction of innovation is generally inefficient. These spillovers allow the firm to distort the innovation decisions of outside researchers, and we explore how the firm can exploit its size in the labor market for researchers to affect the direction of innovation.

<p><b-custom>Technology Paradigms, Lock-in, and Economic Growth</b-custom><br>
with Daron Acemoglu</p>

	<summary style="color: #2a7ae2">Abstract</summary>

	We develop a theory of economic growth in which innovation alternates between dominant technological paradigms and the emerging paradigms that might replace them. Innovation within a paradigm is subject to decreasing returns as “ideas get harder to find,” but innovations for an emerging paradigm only generate profits after it becomes dominant. Our analysis reveals how this trade-off can generate technological lock-in or growth cycles. Long-run growth requires the development of both dominant and emerging paradigms, and we show how creative destruction within and across paradigms distorts this process. We explore methods to identify technological paradigms in the patent data, facilitating empirical analysis of productivity dynamics as industries proceed along paradigms and transition between them. We assess the extent to which declining research productivity can be attributed to the maturation of dominant paradigms, suggesting scope for a growth resurgence as innovators explore alternatives.
