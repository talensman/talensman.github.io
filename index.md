Hi! I'm an assistant professor in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at Harvard Business School.

I study macroeconomics, innovation, and industrial organization using a mix of theory and data. I'm particularly interested in how new technologies drive economic growth and how firm incentives shape this process.
