Hi! I'm a PhD student at MIT Economics.

I study macroeconomics, innovation, and industrial organization using a mix of theory and data. I'm particularly interested in how new technologies drive economic growth and how firm incentives shape this process.

In July 2025, I will join the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at Harvard Business School as an assistant professor.
